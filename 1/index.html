            For this project, we are using a dataset of pictures taken by Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii. Each picture is a set of three glass plate negatives, <br>
            taken with three different color filters of Red, Green, and Blue. For this project we are taking the three negatives and combining them into a single color image.<br>
            <p>To start, we can place the three negatives side by side to get an idea of what they look like. For now we will start with an image with smaller<br>
            filesize, which is an image of a cathedral.</p>
            <img src="media/cathedralBWallthree.png" alt="Black and White Negatives of Cathedral Image"><br>
            <p>This is what the negatives look like with the red, green, and blue filters applied.</p>
            <img src="media/cathedralRGBallthree.png" alt="Negatives of Cathedral Image with Red, Green, Blue filters, respectively"><br>
            <p>Now let us see what happens if we naively overlay the three color-filtered negatives as they are.</p>
            <img style="text-align:center; width:50%" src="media/cathedralUnaligned.png" alt="Poorly aligned full-color photo of Cathedral"><br>
            <p>While we seem to get something resembling full-color, there are clearly many issues with this photo. First and most glaring is the alignment of the negatives is poor,<br>
            giving the image a blurry effect, and we can clearly see the overlaid copies of the image. For the first step of this project, we will focus on this alignment issue.</p>
